                            <p>My name is Javi! I'm chilean I work as a Project Manager in a software development company in Chile.</p>
                            <h2 class="display-4">About this application...</h2>
                            <p>I wanted to understand how software development worked so I joined the Python/Django course from CoderHouse. So far it's been an amazing experience and I've learned a lot! This app is my project to finalize my course! And, of course, it's about dogs, because I love dogs!</p>
                            <h2 class="display-4">What's to come?</h2>
                            <p>I'm moving to France and I hope I keep learning about software development!</p>
